        <item>"Folding refers to protein activities in our bodies. The research of protein folding requires so many calculations that Stanford University asks people to donate their phones' unused processing power to crunch some of the numbers. When you sleep, Stanford University will send a folding problem for your phone to solve. Once calculations are complete, the results are sent back to Stanford."</item>
